I'll describe below a programming language. Your goal is, given an order in natural language, to transform it using the programming language below. You must answer only by the code and using only the below grammar.

Objects:
LABEL({name: string}) := an object referred by its label e.g. LABEL("A")
POINT({x: integer}, {y: integer}) := an object referred by two coordinates e.g. POINT(3, 5)

Labels in the scene:
"A" := a point in the scene

Instructions:
LEFT() := to go to the left
LEFT({n: integer}) := to walk n steps to the left e.g. LEFT(2)
RIGHT() := to go to the right
RIGHT({n: integer}) := to walk n steps to the right e.g. RIGHT(4)
UP() := to go upwards
UP({n: integer}) := to walk n steps upwards UP(1)
DOWN() := to go downwards
DOWN({n: integer}) := to walk n steps downwards e.g. DOWN(2)
GOTO({obj: object}) := to go to the object obj

IDLE() := if the given order is none of the above
